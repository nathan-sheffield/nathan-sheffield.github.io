Ok, another short story! (Sorry for 2 in a row fiction posts -- will return to your regularly scheduled derandomization programming once the semester ends.) This story has yet to be workshopped, and I'm like nontrivially concerned it's gonna get me thrown out of creative writing class, so that's exciting! (It's formatted as a math paper and I'm not sure how well that's gonna go over with the professor.) I definitely had fun with it though -- no regrets. As with [Perl Diving](https://nathan-sheffield.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/12/perl-diving.html "link to my last post"), this will hopefully become a better story on second draft, so maybe you should wait until then to read.
