Hello! This is the zeroeth post in a blog that will hopefully eventually have more posts. I expect to put things here pretty sporadically; there should be some mixture of 
- math things I've been thinking about / working on
- stories of events in my life
- general "philosophy" type stuff
- miscellaneous content (e.g. poetry, tierlists, shaggy dog stories, etc).

The exact ratios of these topics remains to be determined. Also fair warning, posts will probably vary a good deal in terms of quality of writing / comprehensibility. 

That's all I want to say for now. See you next time, world[^1]!

[^1]: Perhaps this is a rather presumptuous sign-off for a blog that will almost certainly have 0 regular readers :thinking:
