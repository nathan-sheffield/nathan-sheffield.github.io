Did you like this post? Are there things you think I should change? You can't leave comments because idk how to set that up, but you should all press ctrl-shift-i on your keyboards, add an extra little "<div>" at the bottom, type up a response there, and then mail a screenshot to Nathan Sheffield at Cambridge MA. If your comments elicit any kind of emotional response, such as can be expressed by an emoticon, I will draw one and return the letter to you within 14 business days.

Yours truly, forever and always,
Nathan
