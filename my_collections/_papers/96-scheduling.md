notes: "I have no idea if these results are interesting to anyone else, but Alek and I had been trying to figure out the optimal competitive ratios here for like 2 years, so it was really exciting to finally beat 2 (even if we still didn't _quite_ make it all the way to ϕ). Incidentally, this problem is the reason the site logo is golden ratio."

“Many hands make light work”, goes the old adage. Or maybe it's “too many cooks spoil the broth”? While Theo Rem has been unusually aware of the fine line between maxims of late, now is probably his maxim minding maximum for this particular pair. The reason: he and his adventuring party have been running boring errands for the king all week, and now, as if they didn't already have enough work, he's recieved a royal decree asking them to deep clean the throne chamber. 

It's a difficult position to be in. He could assign one of his crew to do the job on their own --- but then it would take quite a while. Alternatively, he could ask multiple people to do it, in which case they'd probably step on each other's toes a little bit and be overall less efficient, but at least they'd get it done quickly. 

He'd better decide correctly though, because his crew is already pretty unhappy --- if they discover they'd been stuck there for much longer than necessary just because of Theo's bad decisions, there might be mutiny. Given that he has no clue what, if anything, the capricious monarch will demand of him next, what should Theo do?
