When he'd set out to recruit an adventuring party, Theo had been imagining a process a little more snappy and Gandalf-esque, not these hours upon hours of interviews. However, it had quickly become apparent that the coarse-grained information in the “Heroism and Questing” personal ads just wouldn't be enough to pick people.

Take this fellow, for instance. Theo could've predicted, based on the “23 M, half-orc, barbarian, passionate about skull-cracking and menacing” description, that he'd likely be a better fit for one of the more… hands-on parts of the team. But it was a total roll of the dice whether he'd end up being a qualified Chief Dragon Slayer — a roll which, upon receiving the response “deathly afraid of serpents, Mr. Rem” to the question of “what's your biggest weakness”, Theo was disappointed to learn had come up snake-eyes. “You seem like you'd make a great Junior Axe-Wielding Goon,” Theo acceded, “but unfortunately we filled that position last week. I don't think we'll be able to make you an offer at this point in time.”

Theo glanced resignedly at his list of unfilled positions: 14 openings for fighters, 9 for negotiations/logistics, 6 for skullduggery and subterfuge, and 7 for magic experts. How many interviews would it take to fill them all? With the sort of decisions he'd been making thus far, it seemed likely to be quite a few — early in the process, he made the mistake of hiring a competent sorcerer as a dungeon cartographer, not realizing quite how few-and-far-between magic users were, and now no amount of cajoling could convince her to give up her maps. He had to figure out how to avoid making that kind of blunder again…
