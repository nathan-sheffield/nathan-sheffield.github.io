notes: "I worked on this with Alek Westover; supervised by William Kuszmaul and Martin Farach-Colton. I think it's a neat problem, and probably believe it should be possible to beat this algorithm (maybe even getting polylog(1/ε)-competitive), so you should think about it. Especially if you're really good at subset sums or something."

Captain Rem encouraged people to look on the bright side — shouldn't one be grateful to be so saturated with gold? — but there was still grumbling. The problem was, while the loot their seaward plundering accrued was substantial, the long skinny cargo hold they used to stow said loot was somewhat less so. 

Before the hold was completely full, they always made sure to stop at a port and offload — but even when there was technically enough room, it often took a fair amount of heaving around heavy chests before the crew could find a spot for even a relatively small artifact. If only there was a smarter way to arrange things…
