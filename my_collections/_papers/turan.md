order: 5
conference: "preprint"
notes: "This work was done at the Duluth REU program. I think I believe this conjecture is more likely than not false, but I have no idea how to show it --- there's a couple potential counterexamples noted at the end of the paper, but it seems unlikely that it's tractable to actually compute extremal numbers for those guys. It's actually kinda crazy how little we know about extremal numbers in general; maybe I will blog post about this in the future."
fable: "Fact 1: The king has asked Theo to send invitations to some of the kingdom's nobility for a feast at the palace.\\

Fact 2: Theo is not feeling particularly pleased with the king (as a result of being made to fulfill too many such errands), and would like to ensure this feast is a disaster.\\

The issue is, most of the nobles in the land are too polite (read: too afraid of being beheaded) to cause a scene. So it'll take a careful choice of people to make sure there's enough beef to make this exciting. Theo Rem sees two main options:\\

Option 1: Make sure that everyone on one side of the table is bitter enemies with everyone on the other side of the table. This is sure to be enough to incite an all-out-brawl.\\

Option 2: Failing that, try to recreate _exactly_ the same friend and enemy relationships that faciliated the notorious Food Fight Incident of 1072. In order to make sure that the right sort of alliances form, Theo would not only have to make sure specific pairs of guests are enemies, but also make sure that specific other pairs are _not_ enemies.\\

The question is, does there exist enough animosity in the kingdom to let Theo construct such a malicious guest list?"

In a recent paper, Hunter, Milojevic, Sudakov and Tomon consider the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph containing no copy of the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,s}$ and no *induced* copy of a "pattern" graph $H$. 
    They conjecture that, for $s \geq |V(H)|$, this "induced extremal number" differs by at most a constant factor from the standard extremal number of $H$.
    Towards this, we give bounds on the induced extremal number in terms of degeneracy, which establish some non-trivial relationship between the induced and standard extremal numbers in general. 
    We also show that (as in the case of standard extremal numbers) the induced extremal number is dominated by that of the 2-core of a single connected component.
    Finally, we present some graphs arising from incidence geometry which may serve as counterexamples to the conjecture.
