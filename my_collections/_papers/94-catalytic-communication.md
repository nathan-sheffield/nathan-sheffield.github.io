notes: "I think this is my favourite paper on this list at the moment. 
When first defining this model, I just thought it was kinda a cute story, but thinking more about it felt like it gave more intuition about catalytic space than I was expecting. Also, I was just really delighted to find applications of fun graph theory tools where I wasn't expecting them.
This was done with William Wang, mentored by Ted Pyne."

Theo is locked in the depths of the royal dungeons, on suspicion of intentionally sabotaging the king's dinner party. The guards have been trying to determine whether he and his second-in-command, Cora Larry, have a consistent alibi. 

Which they do. At least, Theo thinks they do: they'd agreed on a detailed lie long in advance. However, as a bizarre interrogation technique, a witch has placed a hex of forgetfulness on both suspects, preventing them from forming more than a couple bits worth of new long-term memories. Now, Theo's concerned the hex may have scrambled some existing memories as a side-effect, possibly making the two stories inconsistent. What he'd love to do is leave some message for Cora in the interrogation room, listing his whole story and asking her to confirm it matches hers --- but there doesn't seem to be anywhere to hide such a message. 

Anywhere, that is, except the Head of the Guard's chessboard. He left a game partway in progress, and the rank-and-file guards won't notice if it's tampered with. The issue, of course, is that when the Head of the Guard returns, if the board isn't exactly as he left it, he'll know it was used to pass information. 

Fortunately, the two conspirators have a plan. When the guards aren't looking, Cora carefuly shuffles the pieces on the board, making sure to preserve all the information of the original position so that she can reset it in her next session. When Theo is brought in, he looks at the board, and commits to memory a small but crucial fact about the position. At his next interrogation, he glances at the pieces, now returned to their original state, and breaks into a confident smirk. 

"I'm ready to talk."
