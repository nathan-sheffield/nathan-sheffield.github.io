notes: "This one came out of a problem suggested in Erik Demaine's ''Fun with Hardness'' class, which I worked on with Brian Liu and Alek Westover. I actually initially thought we weren't going to get tight answers, but then as I wrote it up figured out how to close the gaps --- this is notable as my only experience thus far having something end up _more_ clean than expected when I wrote it down :)"

“Out of sight, out of mind”, goes the old adage. Or maybe it's “familiarity breeds contempt”? Never has Theo Rem been so aware of the fine line between these maxims as now, leading the king's diplomatic party through the burrows of the pig-gnomes.

In order to set up any kind of lasting relations with a particular gnome clan, one has to pay at least three visits to their village, somewhere in the depths of this twisted network of tunnels. However, the milk of porcine kindness is easily strained should one overstay one's welcome: trying to travel through the same village more than five times is a sure way to sow ill-feelings. Far from bringing home the bacon, an unwelcome guest is lucky to bring home their own head.

Looking at the branching (but not too branching) map of tunnels boared between villages, Theo begins to wallow in despair: even if the route he seeks does exist, is it possible to find it?
