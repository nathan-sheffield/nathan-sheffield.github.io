title:  "Graphs with the Same Edge Count in Each Neighbourhood"

order: 7
conference: "preprint"

notes: "Zoe and I started this project together at Duluth. Neither of us are super pro additive combinatorics people, so if you are maybe you'll be able to see how to make the story work for non-abelian Cayley graphs."
fable: "Unable to find conclusive evidence of Theo's misdeeds, the king has agreed to set him free --- under one condition: he must help the king quell the social unrest that's broken out among the giant birds of the kingdom's east cliffs. You see, every year roc society holds a popularity contest, finding the member with the most friends and electing them as the 'roc star' of the nest. This year, however, it appears that **every single roc has exactly the same number of friends**. 
Since the count, the nest has been in a state of ruffled feathers bordering on loon-acy --- some suspect the results are due to ill eagle behaviour, while others are desparately trying to find another way to carrion with the contest.\\

Faced with this rocky issue, Theo acts precipitously: he declares a new condition to be used to break the ties. Every roc's friend group may be the same size, he observes, and yet two equal-sized friend groups need not be equally good. If very few of your friends are friends with *each other*, it's bound to make social gatherings very awkward. So, at Theo's suggestion, the birds swiftly enact a new tiebreaker: they will crown the least awkward roc, as judged by the roc whose friend group has the most overall friendship.
Theo is still congragulating himself on this auspicious idea when the results get back: **all the rocs are equally rocward**!
Staring at the numbers, Theo gawks in disbelief. Must this have been fowl play? Or could it just be an aerie coincidence?"

In a recent paper, Caro, Lauri, Mifsud, Yuster, and Zarb ask which
    parameters $r$ and $c$ admit the existence of an $r$-regular graph such that
    the neighborhood of each vertex induces exactly $c$ edges. They
    show that every $r$ with $c$ satisfying $0\leq c\leq \binom{r}{2}-5r^{3/2}$ is achievable, but no $r$ with $c$ satisfying
    $\binom{r}{2}-\lfloor\frac{r}{3}\rfloor\leq c\leq \binom{r}{2}-1$
    is.  We strengthen the bound in their nonexistence result from
    $\binom{r}{2}-\lfloor\frac{r}{3}\rfloor$ to $\binom{r}{2}-\lfloor\frac{r-2}{2}\rfloor$. Additionally, when the graph
    is the Cayley graph of an abelian group, we obtain a much more
    fine-grained characterization of the achievable values of $c$
    between $\binom{r}{2} - 5r^{3/2}$ and $\binom{r}{2} -
    \lfloor\frac{r-2}{2}\rfloor$, which we conjecture to be the correct
    answer for general graphs as well.
    That result relies on a lemma about approximate subgroups in the "99% regime", quantifying the extent to which nearly-additively-closed subsets of an abelian group must be close to actual subgroups.
    Finally, we consider a generalization to graphs with
    multiple types of edges and partially resolve several open
    questions of Caro et al. about *flip* colorings of graphs.
