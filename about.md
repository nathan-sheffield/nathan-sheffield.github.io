I'm Nathan, currently an undergrad studying math and CS at MIT. A non-exhaustive list of interests:
- Computational complexity and algorithms
- Logic and formal methods
- Extremal graph theory
- Literature (especially if it's 20th century and a little weird)
- Puzzles and puzzlehunts
- Quizbowl / trivia
- Bad puns

If you want to talk to me about any of these things (or contact me for some other reason), feel free to send me an email!
