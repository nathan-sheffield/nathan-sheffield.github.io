I'm Nathan, currently an undergrad studying math and CS at MIT. A non-exhaustive list of interests:
- Computational complexity and algorithms
- Logic and formal methods
- Extremal graph theory
- Absurdist literature (and I suppose plenty of other genres too -- I did say this list was non-exhaustive)
- Puzzles and puzzlehunts
- Quizbowl / trivia
- Bad puns
- Rock climbing

This website is supposed to serve as a place to store things I've worked on / thoughts I've had. The main target audience is really just my future self, but if you're not me you're also welcome to poke around.
