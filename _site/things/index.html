<h3 id="power-from-random-strings-survey"><a href="/assets/things/power_from_kolmogorov.pdf">Power from Random Strings Survey</a></h3>
<p>There’s a really neat line of work examining what problems can be reduced <em>resource-efficiently</em> to the (resource-unbounded) Kolmogorov random strings; this is a survey of some of the main results / open directions there. Written as the final project for Ryan Williams’s complexity theory class.</p>

<h3 id="limits-of-preprocessing"><a href="/assets/things/preprocessing.pdf">Limits of Preprocessing</a></h3>
<p>This is my final project for boolean functions class; it’s an attempt at a more friendly presentation of <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.CCC.2020.17">this paper</a>, which gives partial progress towards showing that inner product remains hard for $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits even after arbitrary preprocessing of both inputs independently.</p>

<h3 id="can-sos-prove-circuit-lower-bounds"><a href="/assets/things/sos-project.pdf">Can SOS Prove Circuit Lower Bounds?</a></h3>
<p>This was the final project for my class on the Sum of Squares method — it’s a survey of a couple results relating to the (im)possibility of formalizing circuit lower bounds in SOS.</p>

<h3 id="testing-permutation-pattern-avoidance"><a href="/assets/things/sublinear-project.pdf">Testing Permutation Pattern Avoidance</a></h3>
<p>For the final project of sublinear-time algorithms, we gave an exposition of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04856">this paper</a>’s results on property testing of pattern-avoiding permutations, and made some minor extensions.</p>

<h3 id="hardness-of-art-gallery-variants"><a href="/assets/things/art_gallery.pdf">Hardness of Art Gallery Variants</a></h3>
<p>The art gallery problem has been shown to be <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3188745.3188868">complete for $\exists \mathbb{R}$</a>; here we give an overview of that result, and give some thoughts on hardness of related problems. Final project for computational geometry class.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-analogs-of-the-canadian-traveler-problem"><a href="/assets/things/quantum-canada.pdf">Quantum Analogs of the Canadian Traveler Problem</a></h3>
<p>This was the final project for my quantum information science class. TLDR: some new pathfinding problem has quadratic speedup with quantum search.</p>

<h3 id="canadian-traveler-problem-survey"><a href="/assets/things/canada-survey.pdf">Canadian Traveler Problem Survey</a></h3>
<p>The reason I was thinking about CTP for that quantum project was because a couple friends and I had earlier written a survey of the (classical) problem for our advanced algorithms class. Most of this is not original research, but should be a reasonably nice introduction to the problem.</p>

<h1 id="other-notes-and-slides-from-undergrad">Other Notes and Slides from Undergrad</h1>

<h3 id="ramsey-theory-notes"><a href="/assets/things/ramsey-notes.pdf">Ramsey Theory Notes</a></h3>
<p>These are notes from my Ramsey theory class spring 2023 (taught by Lisa Sauermann). They’re not especially proofread or anything, but I find myself referring back to them a fair amount, so I put them up on the internet in case they’re useful to other people.</p>

<h3 id="low-degree-ecc-decoding-and-relative-rank-slides"><a href="/assets/things/random_restrictions.pdf">Low-Degree ECC Decoding</a> and <a href="/assets/things/relative_rank.pdf">Relative Rank</a> slides</h3>
<p>These are some slides for a reading group I met with fall 2023. The first of these explains the result from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02870">this paper</a> that $\mathsf{NC}^0[\oplus]$ circuits can’t decode error-correcting codes with constant success probability. The second discusses the preliminaries on relative rank and Nisan-Wigderson design polynomials for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00611">this paper</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mip--re-poster"><a href="/assets/things/mip*-poster.pdf">MIP* = RE poster</a></h3>
<p>This is a poster I made for my quantum computation class, giving a very rough overview of the breaktrough <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> result in quantum complexity.</p>

<h3 id="intro-to-information-theory-slides"><a href="/assets/things/GuessWhoEntropy.pdf">Intro to Information Theory</a> slides</h3>
<p>Some slides explaining the basics of information theory (entropy, KL divergence, Shannon/Huffman coding) in terms of a game of <em>Guess Who?</em></p>

<h3 id="pcp-slides"><a href="/assets/things/PCP.pdf">PCP slides</a></h3>
<p>Here are some slides for a presentation I gave for MIT’s directed reading program sophomore year. We define the PCP theorem and walks through Irit Dinur’s proof.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-cant-do-with-math-slides"><a href="/assets/things/impossibility-class.pdf">What You Can’t Do With Math</a> slides</h3>
<p>This is for a class I taught fall 2021 for high schoolers about a couple of classic impossibility results.</p>

<h1 id="music">Music</h1>

<h4 id="banach-tarski">Banach-Tarski</h4>

<p>My dad used to sing a version of this song as a “musical ditty for math loving kiddies”, so I put this together for him at Christmas one year.</p>

<h4 id="the-scream">The Scream</h4>
<p>I recorded this for my jazz class. I wanted to make something based around augmented 7ths, and it sounded so angsty that I decided to put a spoken-word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream#Sources_of_inspiration">excerpt from Edvard Munch’s diary</a> over the solo section.</p>
<audio controls="" class="audio-embed">
  <source src="/assets/music/scream.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />

<h4 id="vexations">Vexations</h4>
<p>This is a jazz arrangement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexations">Erik Satie’s Vexations</a>, also for that class. Trying to fit vaguely tonal-sounding chords to this was a bit of a nightmare, but I think the result ended up sounding decent (largely thanks to the jazz combo that performed this, led by my lovely professor Lihi Haruvi on alto sax).</p>

#### Tarjan's Waltz
Ok fine I lied, here's one more piece from jazz class. It's not super polished, but this was me trying to do a waltz. I don't really know why I named it after Tarjan; I think I was just thinking about splay trees while recording it.

<h4 id="ancylid">Ancylid</h4>
<p>This is another class project that I was lucky enough to have sight-read by some <a href="https://semiosisquartet.com/">real professional musicians</a>. I’d never tried to write a string quartet before – was a fun experience.</p>
<audio controls="" class="audio-embed">

<h4 id="wollaston">Wollaston</h4>
<p>I took a class called “Electronic Music Composition” – here’s an example of the sort of thing we did. The degree to which this counts as music is perhaps open to debate, but I definitely learned some useful DAW tricks as the class progressed.</p>

<h4 id="gåte-for-døden">Gåte for Døden</h4>
<p>I made this in high school as part of a puzzle. The puzzle chain isn’t followable anymore, but I still think the song is fun (if you can excuse my terrible Norwegian pronunciation).</p>
